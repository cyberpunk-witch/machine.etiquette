- [ ] add sources list
- [ ] separate out readme and etiquette doc
- [ ] check over every bit of the etiquette doc and make sure the things it says are backed up by the citations provided
- [ ] and that links in citations actually go to studies
- [ ] and that methodology actually establishes what is claimed or provides good evidence for it
- [ ] and that studies have good.. study-stats (p value? citations? I forget what metrics are supposed to be best now)
- [ ] find out what metrics to pay attention to
- [ ] also look at reviews of studies to see if they are good
- [ ] seriously, _unnamed popular search engine ai_ has, several times now, in ai suggestions, provided me 'some guy on quora/reddit said this' as it's "citation"
- [ ] that's not a good source, wtf. You're supposed to be less lazy than me at _basic fact checking_. Fuck.
- [ ] add creative-commons-4.0-sharealike-license copy, link
- [ ] get collaborators, strategize over whether this effort is at all useful
- [ ] note limitations in readme
